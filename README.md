# Pico-Wiz

This is a repository to track the progress of development on a magical roguelike heavily inspired by [Rift Wizard](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1271280/Rift_Wizard/)

This is the first game I plan on completing in the pico-8 engine, with the end goal of making a handfull of games that I'd personally enjoy playing on linux handhelds such as the Miyoo Mini


### TODO
- ~~stop enemy healthbar from moving on collision~~
- ~~stop enemy from showing collision with other enemies~~
